# Final Project: Keep Away
* You're a single cyan colored box surrounded by 4 purple balls bouncing around the screen
* Using 2 potentiometers, maneuver the box around the screen while avoiding the balls
* If a ball hits the box, the box will flash dark blue and you'll lose a life
* You have 16 lives with a counter displayed on the 7-segment displays starting at F and going down to 0
* Press the button in the center to reset your lives and to "randomize" the balls' paths
* Use switches SW0 to SW3 to change the balls' speed to increase or decrease the level of difficulty
* Use your own stopwatch to test how long you can last dodging the balls before you run out of lives
